title: About me
---

I’m Taylor Reiter and I am computational biologist and sequencing data enthusiast. 
I’m currently a PhD candidate at University of California, Davis in the Food Science 
Graduate Group. I’m in the labs of Drs. [C. Titus Brown](http://ivory.idyll.org/lab/) 
and [Ben Montpetit](https://montpetitlab.ucdavis.edu/).

I spend my research time:
1. Analyzing metagenomes with [spacegraphcats](https://github.com/dib-lab/2018-paper-spacegraphcats) 
(what does one do with bags of kmers anyway?)
2. Finding ways to make sourmash do more cool things (I can’t plot 69,056,100 comparisons 
at once?! May I have a [random subsample](https://github.com/taylorreiter/yeast-rna-sigs/blob/master/outputs/yeast_sig_comp.matrix.png) please?)
3. Integrating wine metatranscriptomes with metabolomic and genomic data to find vineyard-specific differences

I spend my teaching time:
1. Instructing and improving Data and Software Carpentry workshops
2. Co-coordinating the [Davis R User’s Group](https://d-rug.github.io/) and 
[Meet and Analyze Data](https://dib-training.readthedocs.io/en/pub/#meet-and-analyze-data-mad) help sessions
3. Writing and instructing [other](https://ngs-docs.github.io/2018-cicese-metatranscriptomics/) 
[workshops](https://github.com/ngs-docs/2018-ggg201a)

With my free time I like to:
1. Spend time in the Pacific Northwest
2. Hike, bike, bake, and drink tea
