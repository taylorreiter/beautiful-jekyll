### About this blog and how it came to be
My personal blog built using RMarkdown and markdown, using "Beautiful Jekyll". Want a blog that looks like this? See below for attribution.

### Beautiful Jekyll

> *Copyright 2016 [Dean Attali](http://deanattali.com)*

**Beautiful Jekyll** is a ready-to-use template to help you create an awesome website quickly. Perfect for personal blogs or simple project websites.  [Check out a demo](http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll) of what you'll get after a few minutes.  You can also look at [the creators website](http://deanattali.com) to see it in use, or see examples of websites other people created using this theme [here](#showcased-users-success-stories).

Other snazzy things such as the embedded CV were inspired by @ryanpeek, who also uses the beautiful jekyll template.
